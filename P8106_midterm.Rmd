#Using this dataset, the researcher planned to build a prediction model of antibody levels, aiming to understand how demographic and clinical factors influence antibody responses and how antibody levels change over time following vaccination. Please help the researcher build this model.

#A few months after the initial data collection, the researcher collected a new, independent dataset (dat2.RData) with the same structure as dat1.RData. Evaluate the robustness and generalizability of your prediction model using the new dataset. Does the model generalize well to this new dataset? If the model does not generalize well, discuss possible reasons.
